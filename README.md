# R for Machine Learning

The `tidyverse` is a collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. As a modern-time R programmer, there is no reason for us not to use it. 

The `tidyverse` and `tidymodel` frames make model training, prediction, interpretation more streamlined. Moreover `tidymodel` and `caret` provided model training and prediction APIs.

This repo contains tutorials with R codes to fully take advantages of the frameworks for statistical models and machine learning.
